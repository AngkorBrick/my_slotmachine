	The NXT Color Sensor is able to perform three unique functions. 
	It acts as a color sensor, distinguishing among six colors; it works as a light 
	sensor, detecting light intensities â€“ both reflected light and ambient light; 
	and it works as a color lamp, emitting red, green, or blue light. When Color 
	sensor programms in Light Sensor Mode, this sensor has the exact same 
	functionality as described above. However, it can also be programmed in Color 
	Sensor mode. When doing so, the sensor can detect 6 different colors: Black, 
	White, Blue, Green, Yellow and Red. A third functionality of this device is 
	Lamp Mode, where it functions as a basic light, optionally Red, Green or Blue.

The coin slot is designed with a Color Sensor which distinguishes the color between the coin 
and the wall of the coin slot when the coin runs across the sensor.

<p style="text-align: justify;font-size:1em; width: 700">
The lever is designed with a touch sensor. The Touch Sensor gives the robot a sense of touch. 
The Touch Sensor detects when it is being pressed by something and when it is released again. 
After putting a coin in the coin slot, players can push the lever to make the reels rotating.

The lever is also designed with a <em>tension spring</em>. After the player pulls the lever, 
the spring pulls the lever back to its original position.
